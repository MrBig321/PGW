# A pictographic writing system - A Proposal 

I started off from the Chinese Seal Script.
There is a wonderful and freely available book:

Leon Wieger - Chinese Characters : Their Origin, Etymology, History, CLassification And Signification. 
              A Thorough Study From Chinese Documents.
              
It explains how the characters got distorted during the millenea (or at least centuries).
The only drawback of the book is that sometimes it is very difficult to make out a character.

Other recommended books (also freely downloadable):

Wilder, Ingram - Analysis Of Chinese Characters

Li Leyi - Tracing The Roots Of Chinese Characters: 500 Cases


Initially I simply wanted to learn the Chinese Seal Script but either I did not manage to find all the necessary characters/symbols 
or they were defined in a too complicated way.

That is why I made some changes to existing characters or invented new ones.

For example on page 6, there is the character "Contradiction": nose added to the shape of man in order to imply turning away from each other.

On page 17, "Words, Talk, Say" a tongue was added to a mouth to emphasise speaking/talking and not only a sound.

However a mouth without a tonge can still mean speaking/talking wherever it is clear from the context. 

On page 17, the character "Absurd, Impossible" was invented: a fish speaking.

On page 21, the character "To Look Around" was invented. The characters "To Look" and "To Go Round, To Rotate, Around, ..." were combined.

But still, most of the characters are from the original Chinese Small Seal Script.

In a former version of this document, simpler characters were defined before the more complicated ones.

It made reading from cover to cover easy. However whenever a character had to be looked up, it was hell.

That is why in this version I have tried to group the characters according to radicals.

The first five pages contain the base radicals.

On the next pages are: 
- the shape of a man,
- a plant,
- a hand,
- a heart,
- a tree,
- rain,
- a mouth,
- a foot,
- a fire/color, 
- a mountain,
- an eye,
- to divide,
- a house/a shed,
- a cave,
- to cover/conceil,
- religions, 
- a door/gate(to ask),
- chest/box,
- the Sun,
- union,
- a dog,
- a bull,
- water/liquid,
- earth, 
- miscellaneous(page 29),
- special(page 34, e.g. BecauseOf).

Some characters were left out from the miscellaneous-pages: they are on page 35 right after the special characters.

There is a simple grammar, which can be written in two ways.

The first version of the grammar is defined on page 36.

With this version of the grammar, to have "from a house" write: 

   "From/ToLeave/ToSeparate" character and then "Habitation/Abode" (page 23)
   
With the second version of the grammar(page 37), to have "from a house" write: 

   the character "Habitation/Abode" (page 23) and then above this character add the symbol of "From" which can be found on page 37.
   
The second version of the grammar was invented in order to have shorter sentences (i.e. use fewer characters).

The groupings come next:
 - family relations (page 38)
 - meals, ... (miscellaneous) (page 39)
 - geography, astronomy (page 40, 41)
 - electronics/computer/internet (page 41)
 - internal organs (page 42)
 - body parts (page 43)
 - clothes (page 44)
 - mammals (page 45, 46)
 - animals (oviparity) (page 47)
 - animals, roe (fish eggs, and the like) (page 48)
 - animals, insects (page 48)
 - fruits (page 49)
 - vegetables, seeds, grain (page 50)
A summary on page 51 can be found.
A simple idea of recording time is shown on page 52.
